    "text": "Would you like RSE South West to be a distinct group, and what would you like to see from this group?\n\nIn-person events are preferred over online for a regional group​\n\nYes, there was strong support for RSE South West to be a distinct group and focus on organising in person meetings.\nThe aim was to have four meetups a year. Three of these would be based in the South West, with the fourth being the annual RSE conference in September. The local meetups will rotate amongst member institutions, with the expectation that the larger groups in the University of Exeter, University of Bristol and the Met Office might do the majority of the hosting. Members from the Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML) would also like to host future events (depending on funding).\nThe next meeting would aim to be in November/December 2025 and could potentially be hosted by the University of Exeter (to be confirmed).\nThe main costs for these events are catering and invited speaker travel. For catering, there was a suggestion that either:\n\na small contribution could be asked for (about £5) to cover this, or\ncatering could be limited to tea/coffee rather than also including lunch (though lunch was highlighted as an important networking opportunity as well).\n\n\n\n\nLocal identity\n\nWe would like to continue to extend invites to institutions in the South West of the UK, including the University of Bath, UK Hydrographic Office in Taunton and members of the GW4 Alliance.\nFor the longevity of the group​, there was a suggestion to set up a cross-institute commitee which could advise on events. This would require further discussion."

This talk gives a brief overview of how the django-modeltranslation package was implemented to enhance the reach of materials uploaded to the website.\n        \n      \n  \n    \n      \n        Support for the Python array API standard in SciPy\n        Jake Bowhay\n        \n          Slides\n          Video\n        \n        \n          Abstract\n          Array oriented computing in Python was once straightforward: NumPy for arrays, and SciPy for foundational scientific functions. However as of today, the array library ecosystem has expanded to include CuPy, PyTorch, JAX, and others, each addressing use cases beyond NumPy's scope. This talk introduces how SciPy is evolving to support this diverse landscape by adopting the Python array API standard. I'll briefly introduce what this standard is and how it is enabling SciPy to write code that is interoperable across array libraries.\n        \n      \n  \n    \n      \n        Make make great again\n        James Frost\n        \n          GitHub repo\n          Video\n        \n      \n  \n    14:35\n    Networking and refreshments\n  \n    14:50\n    \n      \n        Discussion session\n        Rachel Tunnicliffe\n        \n          The future of RSE South West events\n          RSE groups and how they're organised\n          RSE best practices\n        \n        \n          Summary of discussion\n          Padlet\n          Video\n        \n      \n  \n    15:20\n    \n      \n        Closing remarks\n        James Thomas, Rachel Tunnicliffe, Rita Rasteiro, Léo Gorman\n        \n          Video\n          Feedback received\n        \n      \n  \n    15:30\n    End of day and optional pub trip"

In recent years, with shifts to automated sensing, more advanced data processing and web-based tools we have seen an increased need for software development skills across all science areas in the organisation. The Digital Innovation and Marine Autonomy (DIMA) group at PML was established to work across science areas and the Research Software Engineering (RSE) team at PML sits within this. This talk will provide an introduction to Research Software Engineering at PML, how the group is structured and discuss some of the current projects we are working on.\n        \n      \n  \n    11:00\n    Refreshments\n  \n    11:15\n    \n      \n        LCAT - the Local Climate Adaptation Tool\n        Simon Kirby, University of Exeter\n        \n          Abstract\n          LCAT is a web tool that brings together climate, health and vulnerability research, supporting local policy makers as they address climate adaptation challenges. Developed by Simon in the Exeter RSE group, LCAT is the result of a co-design process with Cornwall County Council, and academic colleagues in Penryn. The tool is currently live, under continual development, and can be accessed at: https://lcat.uk. In this talk, I will give a demo of the tool, discuss its architecture and some technical details, and highlight some technical and non-technical challenges faced during its development and release. Questions on any aspects of the tool will be very welcome.

Using Carpentries style lessons we have been trialling new Git and GitHub training for use by the Met Office and other organisations.\n        \n      \n  \n    \n      \n        The Transatlantic Data Science Academy\n        Damian Wilson, Met Office\n        \n          Abstract\n          The Transatlantic Data Science Academy is a collaboration between the Met Office and its US counterparts, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA), looking at extending  career development advice and opportunities in the fields of research software engineering, data science, data engineering and data assimilation science. Over the last two years It has supported scientist visits, training and events (including this one!). In this presentation I will talk about its aims, some of its activities, and how we might take it into the future to support your careers.\n        \n      \n  \n    12:15\n    Lunch & networking\n  \n    13:15\n    \n      \n        The X-Cited programme for GW4 RTP career development\n        Nicole Whippey, University of Exeter\n        \n          Abstract\n          The X-Cited programme aims to improve RTP (research technical professional) career development through creating communities of practice, training opportunities, industry challenge projects, and introducing junior RTP roles into the career pathway. Creating GW4 communities of practice will facilitate knowledge sharing, expertise and networking; gaining visibility of skills and opportunities within GW4 and externally. The Digital Community of Practice will facilitate both understanding training needs and providing or sharing training opportunities for RSEs as well as all Digital RTPs. Industry challenge projects (ICPs) comprise a 3 day sandpit that result in project proposals for solving real world problems set by industry, and subsequent 2-month projects between GW4 RTPs and industry. ICPs will facilitate RTPs gaining experience of working with industry, and will showcase the capabilities, knowledge and skills, as well as facilities of GW4 institutions and their technicians to industry. This is hoped to build more industry and HE collaborations directly with RTPs instead of the traditional academic routes. Finally, 4 junior research technical professionals (1 RSE) will be recruited for two years to create new routes into becoming an RTP, and provide resources for projects whilst other RTPs are engaging on industry challenge projects.\n        \n      \n  \n    13:45\n    Group photo\n  \n    13:50\n    \n      \n        Tour of the Met Office\n        Andy Malcolm, Met Office\n      \n  \n    14:40\n    Refreshments\n  \n    14:55\n    \n      \n        Machine Learning (ML) Weather Forecasting and Experiment Tracking\n        Ben Fitzpatrick, Met Office\n        \n          Abstract\n          ML weather forecasting - current Met Office and Alan Turing Institute efforts to predict the weather with graph neural networks.
