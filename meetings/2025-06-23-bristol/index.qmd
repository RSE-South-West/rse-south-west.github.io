## Purpose

Following a successful event at the Met Office in February, the University of Bristol is hosting a further meeting on Monday 23 June.
It will be another day to **showcase interesting topics, share knowledge and build networks**.
It aims to complement the annual RSE conference and be useful to those in the South West / GW4 who are not part of a larger RSE group.

All are welcome, whether or not you are from the South West of the UK, and whether or not you [self-define as a Research Software Engineer (RSE)](https://society-rse.org/what-is-an-rse/).

        <blockquote>CFMS (the Centre for Modelling and Simulation) is a Bristol-based independent digital engineering consultancy which collaborates with industry and academia to solve complex problems. CFMS is working with an industrial client to develop and deploy novel simulation tools to plan the movements of a network of automated overhead cranes in a factory. This is an example of a multi-agent pathfinding problem, with the objective of maximising the factory’s throughput for any given manufacturing schedule. This talk discusses the value of simulation at the conceptual design stage for a highly complex system. It also covers some of the challenges of creating tools for immediate industrial application - with a technology stack requiring a combination of rapid software development, automated deployment and high performance compute facilities to achieve the project’s aims.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>Array oriented computing in Python was once straightforward: NumPy for arrays, and SciPy for foundational scientific functions. However as of today, the array library ecosystem has expanded to include CuPy, PyTorch, JAX, and others, each addressing use cases beyond NumPy's scope. This talk introduces how SciPy is evolving to support this diverse landscape by adopting the Python array API standard. I'll briefly introduce what this standard is and how it is enabling SciPy to write code that is interoperable across array libraries.</blockquote>
