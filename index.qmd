title:  Welcome to RSE South West
---
{{< include meetings/next_meeting.qmd >}}



We are a community of research software engineers mainly from the South West of the UK and GW4 Universities who are not affiliated with a larger regional RSE group. 

Our aim is to be a regional community for **building networks, form collaborations and share knowledge**. We are doing this through several [meetings](meetings/index.qmd) aimed to take place at regular intervals.




# Be part of our community!

All are welcome, whether or not you are from the South West of the UK, and whether or not you [self-define as a Research Software Engineer (RSE)](https://society-rse.org/what-is-an-rse/).

The easiest way to communicate with everyone is via the `#rse-south-west` channel on the UK RSE Slack instance. Or join our mailing list to stay in touch with events!
