title:  Welcome to RSE South West
---



We are a community of research software engineers mainly from the South West of England and GW4 Universities who are not affiliated with a larger regional RSE group. 

Our aim is to be a regional community for **buiding networks, form collaborations and share knowledge**. We are doing this through several [meetings](meetings/meetings.qmd) aimed to take place at regular intervals.





 TODO: add group photo from Bristol meeting.

# Be part of our community!

All are welcome, whether or not you are from the South West of the UK, and whether or not you [self-define as a Research Software Engineer (RSE)](https://society-rse.org/what-is-an-rse/).

The easiest way to communicate with everyone is via the [#rse-south-west](https://ukrse.slack.com/archives/C085EGAULJ3) channel on the [UK RSE Slack instance](https://ukrse.slack.com/signup?redir=/archives/C085EGAULJ3). Or join our mailing list!
