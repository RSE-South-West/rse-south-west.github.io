Our goal is to meet in-person a few times each year, rotating locations across the South West region. It is a day to **showcase interesting topics, share knowledge and build networks**.

These meetings aim to complement the annual RSE conference and be useful to those in the South West / GW4 who are not part of a larger RSE group.
