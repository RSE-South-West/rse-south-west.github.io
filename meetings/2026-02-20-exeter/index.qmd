## Contribution submission/registration

Registration has now closed due to reaching maximum capacity.

## Information for the day

### Venue Information

The meeting will take place at the [Peter Chalk Centre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MzBheq2z6JYUG8ReA), with all sessions held in the Newman Red Lecture Theatre.

The day begins with refreshments from 09:30, with the meeting starting promptly at 10:00. Lunch and tea/coffee breaks will be provided in the Peter Chalk Centre foyer/hub space. For environmental/budgetary reasons, we will not be providing bottled water. There is a water station at the venue so we encourage you to bring a reusable water container. There is also a cafe onsite and various food/drink outlets around campus.

### Arriving by Train

If you are arriving at Exeter St Davids station it is approximately a 20‑minute (uphill) walk to the Peter Chalk Centre. Alternatively, you can take the Number 4 bus which goes up to the University from [this bus stop at St Davids](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9nifeVNDNJGc8QMc7).

### Parking

Visitor parking (paid) is available near the venue, but please note that parking on campus is limited, so public transport is recommended when possible. The [Campus Map](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/our-campuses/streatham-campus/#map) shows visitor parking locations and [accessible parking is marked in this document](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/v8media/aboutus/visitus/streatham-map-area-a.pdf).

### Post-event social

After the meeting, we will head to [The Imperial](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TKrWzCkuciTFCyXD9) for an informal social. The Imperial is conveniently located between Exeter St Davids train station and the University’s Streatham Campus, making it a convenient stop off on the way to the station.

## Code of conduct

All participants are expected to adhere to the [Society of RSE code of conduct for events](https://society-rse.org/about/policies/code-of-conduct/).
