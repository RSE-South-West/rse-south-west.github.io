## Purpose

Following a successful event at the Met Office in February, the University of Bristol is hosting a further meeting on Monday 23 June.
It will be another day to **showcase interesting topics, share knowledge and build networks**.
It aims to complement the annual RSE conference and be useful to those in the South West / GW4 who are not part of a larger RSE group.

All are welcome, whether or not you are from the South West of the UK, and whether or not you [self-define as a Research Software Engineer (RSE)](https://society-rse.org/what-is-an-rse/).
